Assignment 9

encryption.py
hp.txt
README.txt

Iâ€¦. could barely do this assignment without the help of everyone. There were so many parts, and so much was going on.
I think my brain just shut off by this point of the semester. It was one of the most difficult things I have ever done,
and again, could not do it without the help of Gabriel, Zach, Nikita, and ofc stack overflow and other coding websites

Zach - helped me with read and write functions, and looked at code for me
Gabriel - showed me code for encrypt and build dictionary and find shift, answered questions I had
Nikita - helped me proofread my code, showed me decrypt,
All of them - emotional support
Stack Overflow Websites - general checking for how to do the code
