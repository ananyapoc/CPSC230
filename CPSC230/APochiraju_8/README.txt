Assignment 8 

inventory.py
README.txt

Was pretty difficult, was able to understand the first part of the code relatively ok, but when I ended up working with Zach was when I was able to better understand what was happening. Overall ok assignment. 

Zach Baker - partner in my assignment
Gabriel - answered my questions for him about how to code
Nikita - answered questions on how to code it
