Assignment 5

THIS WAS REALLY HARD
Conceptually I have not been able to grasp the differences between functions and methods, when to apply what, and other areas of this that I would otherwise need to be successful on an assignment such as this one. 

Zach Baker - I asked him for help in checking my code and offering tips
Gabriel - gave me lots of help in the “construct” section and helped explain his thinking in the “deconstruct” process, otherwise giving me inspiration
Nikita - tried to offer me her way of going through the assignment, talked with her about the assignment generally

this website was of great help to give me a basic structure that I could originally base my code off and work backwards from to get a better understanding of how to do this assignment
Dad
-helped me with understanding the overall concepts behind what I was doing and helped me through the deconstruct section of this especially
