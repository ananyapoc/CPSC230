Assignment 6

statistics_program.py
README.txt

Had some initial difficulty, but once I got through the initial while loop, I
found it easier to go through this assignment and it was logically pretty 
reasonable to go through.

Sreevidya (cousin) - called her to get initial help on the beginning while loop 
Kashish - helped me with understanding the formulas from the instruction sheet
and how to convert them to coding language
