This code has errors, and does not run properly. The overall structure is correct, but I had way too much difficulty with this. After spending 5 hours on it and calling Gabriel twice and asking Nikita for help multiple times, I could not understand this. Im sorry. 

Gabriel - showed me his code and worked with me step by step multiple times to try to help me figure out my errors
Nikita - helped in class to help me figure out how to get started on the code
